# Feature-Based Tech Stack Recommendations

## Overview
The tech stack recommendation system has been refactored to prioritize **project features and requirements** over rigid project type categories. This provides more accurate and relevant technology recommendations.

## Key Changes

### Before (Project Type Driven)
- Recommendations were primarily based on `projectType` (e.g., "Web Application", "Mobile App")
- All "Web Application" projects would get similar recommendations regardless of their actual requirements
- Limited flexibility for projects that don't fit neatly into predefined categories

### After (Feature Driven)
- Recommendations are based on a **priority system** that considers:
  1. **Features** (Gaming, Machine Learning, Real-time Updates, etc.)
  2. **Performance requirements** (High Performance, System Integration)
  3. **Team constraints** (Experience level, Team size, Budget)
  4. **Project type** (only when platform-specific, like Mobile/Desktop)

## Priority System

### Frontend Recommendations Priority:
1. **Gaming applications** → Game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine)
2. **Data Science/ML** → Python-based solutions (Streamlit, PyQt)
3. **High Performance** → Native solutions (Qt C++, Flutter)
4. **Mobile-specific** → React Native, Expo, Flutter
5. **Desktop-specific** → Electron, Tauri, Qt
6. **SEO-critical** → Static generators (Hugo, Next.js)
7. **Real-time** → Next.js with Socket.io
8. **E-commerce** → Next.js, WordPress/WooCommerce
9. **Data visualization** → Dash (Python)
10. **Large team/Enterprise** → Angular (TypeScript)
11. **Beginner + Low budget** → React with Vite
12. **Default** → Vue.js

### Backend Recommendations Priority:
1. **Static content** → No backend needed
2. **Gaming** → C++, C# with ASP.NET Core
3. **Machine Learning** → Python with FastAPI
4. **Data Processing** → Python with Django
5. **High Performance** → Rust, Go
6. **Real-time** → Go with WebSocket, Node.js with Socket.io
7. **E-commerce** → Laravel, Spring Boot, Node.js
8. **Large team** → Java with Spring Boot
9. **Beginner + Low budget** → Python with Flask
10. **Small team with auth/storage** → Supabase
11. **Default** → Python with Django

## Examples

### Same Project Type, Different Features:

```javascript
// All are "Web Application" but get different recommendations:

// SEO-focused blog
features: ["SEO Optimization"]
→ Frontend: Hugo (Go), Backend: Static Hosting

// Gaming platform  
features: ["Gaming", "High Performance"]
→ Frontend: Unreal Engine (C++), Backend: C++ with Custom Engine

// ML dashboard
features: ["Machine Learning", "Data Processing"]
→ Frontend: Streamlit (Python), Backend: Python with FastAPI
```

### Feature Combinations:
- **Gaming + High Performance** → Unreal Engine + C++ Custom Engine
- **ML + Data Processing** → Streamlit + FastAPI
- **Real-time + Advanced** → Next.js + Go with WebSocket
- **Payment + SEO** → Next.js + Node.js/Express
- **Beginner + Low Budget** → React/Vite + Flask

## Benefits

1. **More Accurate Recommendations**: Tech stacks match actual project requirements
2. **Flexible Categorization**: Projects aren't forced into rigid type categories
3. **Feature-Driven Decisions**: Each feature influences the recommendation
4. **Better Resource Utilization**: Avoids over-engineering or under-engineering
5. **Experience-Appropriate**: Considers developer skill level and team size

## Testing

Run the test files to see the new system in action:

```bash
node test_feature_based_recommendations.mjs
node test_comparison.mjs
node test_mobile_desktop.mjs
```

## Backward Compatibility

- Project type is still considered when platform-specific (Mobile App → mobile frameworks)
- All existing functionality remains intact
- The system gracefully falls back to sensible defaults
